QANBAN - README

Information for developing on the Qanban application - basic instructions to get started.


1. Make sure you have Grails installed on your computer. (http://grails.org/)
   This build currently uses Grails v 1.1.1
2. With git installed, "git init" and "git clone git://github.com/qbranchcode/Qanban.git" in your prefered folder.

Good to know
By default, in development mode the application will create an admin user, testadmin (password: AdminPassword).
Qanban uses HSQLDB file for database storage. This can be changed by editing DataSource.groovy in grails-app/conf/ folder.

Now you should be ready to start develop!
